# DA_project

In this project, we explore a rich dataset of first names of babies born in the US, that spans a period of more than 100 year.
This simple dataset can help us uncover so many interesting stories, and that is exactly what we are going to be doing.

We will try to find trending name over decades (male vs female), most popular names (male vs female), 
predict for a given name the probability of this person being alive, etc..
